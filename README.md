## Project Structure and Documentation

This repository contains:
- **code/** – client code that interacts with the MinIO instance.
- **screenshots/** – screenshots showing the terminal output and MinIO web interface running in Docker.
- **README.md** – contains the theoretical research and answers to all questions.

## How the Work Was Done
1. Researched the key concepts of Object Storage and S3.
2. Deployed a MinIO instance locally using Docker and verified access through WSL and browser.
3. Wrote client code to perform object operations (create, list, read, update, delete).
4. Documented all steps and included screenshots as proof of execution.
